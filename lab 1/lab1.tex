\makeatletter
%%The \makeatletter command temporarily defines »@« as a normal character to enable changes to internal LaTeX macros outside packages (STY) or classes (CLS).
\let\thetitle\@title
%%\let allows you to copy the content of a command into a new command.
\let\theauthor\@author
%%Thus \let\foo\bar defines \foo to have the value that \bar had at the point of definition.
\makeatother
% With \makeatother this process is reversed and the »@« is set to its original character category (other). The »@« is used to protect the internal LaTeX macros. Hence you should be very careful when using these two commands.
\pagestyle{fancy}
%%After that, the "fancy" style is set by \pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
%%The command \fancyhf{} clears the header and footer, otherwise the elements of the default "plain" page style will appear. 
\rhead{\theauthor}
%%Prints the text included inside the braces on the right side of the header. 
\lhead{\thetitle}
%%Prints the text set inside the braces on the left side of the header.
\cfoot{\thepage}
%%\cfoot{Page \thepage}  Prints the word "Page" and next the page number which is automatically set by \thepage on the center of the footer.

                %% Importing a graphic is done by using the command \includegraphics[key1=...,key2=...,etc.]{ﬁlename} Optional parameters—called “keys”—enable the figure to be resized, rotated, cropped, trimmed, etc. These keys and their functions are listed below.

        \subsection*{Topic:}
        \subsubsection*{Study and understanding the principles of operation and use of the distributed version control system.}
        \subsection*{Theory:}
        Versioning Systems (VCS, Version Control Systems) serve to manage multiple versions of files included in a collaborative project. Every change made to the project element is memorized with the author of the change. It is important to note that at any time it is possible to return to an earlier version of the entity.

        The main motivation consists in the possibility that different members of the team, possibly located in remote geographical spaces, can work simultaneously on the project, and finally, their modifications will be merged into new versions of the project. There are also other benefits. When a bug is noticed, it may return to a previous version in order to determine when it was inserted into the program. At the same time, one branch development can be followed, in which multiple versions of the project are being developed - for example one that wants to remove the bugs, and the other, which is intended to add of new functionalities before shedding existing ones.

        \subsection*{Tasks:}

        Create distant repository using one of the git services gitlab/github/bitbucket and synchronize it with local repository.

        In figure 1  you can observe already existing repository created at laboratory. To make things done I created a local repository with \textbf{Init} command, I added dummy pdf file and added it to rep. with \textbf{add .} command. Later I created a repo on GitHub and cloned it with \textbf{ clone} command. I  
                
        \newpage
        \subsection*{Conclusion}
        During This lab work i refreshed my knowledge of VCS and GitHub in particular. I can mention that GIT became an standard in developing. It allows developers to work distantly and speeds up the process itself, being a tool for CI/CD.
